# Total Target Calculator

## Description
The Total Target Calculator is a JavaScript function that computes the distribution of an annual target over the months of a specified date range, excluding Fridays from the count of working days. It returns the number of working days per month (excluding Fridays), the monthly targets for each month, and the total target achieved within that range.

## Instructions to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Open your JavaScript environment or use Node.js to run the function.
4. Call the `calculateTotalTarget` function with the desired parameters.

## Explanation of the Function
The function `calculateTotalTarget` takes three parameters:
- `startDate` (string): The start date of the range (YYYY-MM-DD format).
- `endDate` (string): The end date of the range (YYYY-MM-DD format).
- `totalAnnualTarget` (number): The total annual target to be distributed.

### How It Works
1. **Date Conversion**: Converts the `startDate` and `endDate` into JavaScript `Date` objects.
2. **Working Days Calculation**: Iterates through each day in the range and counts the number of days that are not Fridays (day index 5).
3. **Monthly Target Calculation**:
   - The total annual target is divided evenly across all 12 months.
   - Targets are only assigned to months that contain working days.
4. **Result Formatting**: Returns a JSON string that includes:
   - The number of working days excluding Fridays for each month.
   - Monthly targets for those months.
   - The total target achieved over the specified date range.

## Example of Usage
```javascript
console.log(calculateTotalTarget('2024-01-01', '2024-03-31', 5220));
```

## Assumptions and Limitations
- The function assumes that the input dates are valid and in the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD).
- It only excludes Fridays from the working days calculation. Other holidays or non-working days are not considered.
- The function evenly distributes the target across months regardless of the number of working days in each month.
